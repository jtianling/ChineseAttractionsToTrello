# ChineseAttractionsToTrello
Add the Chinese 5A, 4A attractions to trello as checklist organized by province 


# How to Use

1. Tested only in ruby 2.2.2
2. Depends on [ruby-trello](https://github.com/jeremytregunna/ruby-trello)
3. Need follow by ruby-trello's turtorial to get trello's PUBLIC_KEY and MEMBER_TOKEN to config the script
4. Get CARD_ID from the card url in trello and config the script
5. run the script with ruby.

# If you don't like trello or ruby

Just use the 4A.txt and 5A.txt for the attractions list. I think there is hardly another list in the world easy for programming. btw, I created the list myself from useless and ugly text data.(from Baidu)
